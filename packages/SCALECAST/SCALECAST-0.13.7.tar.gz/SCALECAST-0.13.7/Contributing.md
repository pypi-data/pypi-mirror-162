# Contributing

Want to contribute? Email mikekeith52@gmail.com with your ideas. Please also consider opening issues or feature requests using the Issues tab in GitHub. We could also use more example notebooks displayed in our [examples](https://scalecast-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) webpage. If you fork the [scalecast-examples](https://github.com/mikekeith52/scalecast-examples) repository and submit a merge request with a good notebook that showcases scalecast, we will host it and give you credit. We would love to add more models to the package as well, so please let us know your suggestions.
