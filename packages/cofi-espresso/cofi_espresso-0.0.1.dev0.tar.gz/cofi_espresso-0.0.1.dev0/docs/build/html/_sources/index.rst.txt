Welcome to the documentation of Inversion Test Problems!
========================================================

Inversion Test Problems (ITP) is a collection of clearly defined forward codes
that simulate physical processes from many disciplines within the geosciences
and elsewhere. The goal of ITP is to 
bring together people developing physical simulations with those who need them.
ITP's simple and consistent code structure enables users to access a wide range
of different forward code and contributors to share their solutions with a wider
audience. Having the basic set up and several examples in
place already, we hope to encourage more examples be developed and be contributed.
