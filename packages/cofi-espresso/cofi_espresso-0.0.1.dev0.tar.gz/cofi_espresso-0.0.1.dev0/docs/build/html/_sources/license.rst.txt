Inversion Test Problems is a community driven project to create a large suite
of forward simulations to enable researchers to get example data without the
need to understand each individual problem in detail.

Licensing is done individually by each contributor. If a contributor wants to
freely share their code example we recommend the xxx license. To determine the
license of an existing Inversion Test Problem, please consult the readthedocs
section of that problem.
