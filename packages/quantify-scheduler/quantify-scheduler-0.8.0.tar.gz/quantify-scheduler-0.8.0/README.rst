Quantify is a python based data acquisition platform focused on Quantum Computing and solid-state physics experiments.
It is build on top of `QCoDeS <https://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/>`_ and is a spiritual successor of `PycQED <https://github.com/DiCarloLab-Delft/PycQED_py3>`_.
Quantify currently consists of `quantify-core <https://pypi.org/project/quantify-core/>`_ and `quantify-scheduler <https://pypi.org/project/quantify-scheduler/>`_.

Take a look at the `latest documentation for quantify-scheduler <https://quantify-quantify-scheduler.readthedocs-hosted.com/>`_ or use the switch in the bottom of left panel to read the documentation for older releases.

Quantify-scheduler is a python module for writing quantum programs featuring a hybrid gate-pulse control model with explicit timing control.
The control model allows quantum gate- and pulse-level descriptions to be combined in a clearly defined and hardware-agnostic way.
Quantify-scheduler is designed to allow experimentalists to easily define complex experiments, and produces synchronized pulse schedules to be distributed to control hardware.

.. caution::

    This is a pre-release **alpha version**, major changes are expected. Use for testing & development purposes only.
