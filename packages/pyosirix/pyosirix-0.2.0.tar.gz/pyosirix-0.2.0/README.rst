PyOsirix and gRPC
=================

This provides a Pythonic interface that uses the osirixgRPC plugin to
interact with OsiriX and Horos, to provide access to functionality
through the gRPC protocol. This will supercede the previous
implementation of pyOsiriX as it will be general, and easy to maintain.

-  Free software: BSD license
-  Documentation: https://osirixgrpc.github.io/

Installation
============

**Requirements**

-  Python 3+ (https://www.python.org/)
-  Horos/Osirix (https://horosproject.org/)

**Instructions**

Using pip:

::

   pip install pyosirix

Using it from github for development purposes:

::

   git clone git@github.com:osirixgrpc/pyosirix.git
   cd pyosirix
   # Create your own scripts with main function to test the functionality, note that you need to start an OsirixService first and have Horos/Osirix open.

   # See unit tests for examples
