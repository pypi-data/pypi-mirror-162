TGPy is a tool for running Python expressions and Telegram API scripts, built on top of [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon).

- Do Python calculations in dialogs
- Use code to send messages, save files, analyze chats and more
- Set up functions to automate your Telegram actions

## Getting started

Python 3.9+ required. Install TGPy and connect it to your Telegram account:

```shell
> pip install tgpy
> tgpy
```

Youâ€™re ready now. Send Python code to any chat, and it will run. Change your message to change the result.

## Inspiration

TGPy is inspired by [FTG](https://gitlab.com/friendly-telegram/friendly-telegram) and similar userbots. However, the key concept is different: TGPy is totally based on usage of code in Telegram rather than plugging extra modules. This leads both to convenience of single-use scripts and reusage flexibility.

## Credits

TGPy is built on [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon), which allows to integrate Telegram features in Python code.

Basic code transformation (such as auto-return of values) is based on [meval](https://github.com/penn5/meval).
