# CodeGaze: A library for evaluating and debugging code generation models

Code gaze implements a set of evaluation metrics and visualization tools for debugging code generation models.

![](docs/images/screen.jpg)

CodeGaze is build around a set of abstractions that allow for the evaluation of code generation models.

- Dataset: An example code generation dataset e.g. humaneval.
- Experiment: A set of parameters that define the evaluation of a code generation model. Each experiment specifies things like the dataset, model properties (temperature, n_completions), and some metric properties.
- Model: A code generation model that can be evaluated. This is either an OpenAI model or a HuggingFace model.

The basic starting point is to run an experiment on a dataset with a list of models.

## Installation

```bash
pip install codegaze
```

Install locally from this repo:

- Clone the repository
- Navigate to the directory and run `pip install -e .`
- Run `codegaze ui --port 8080` to see debugging UI on port 8080.

## Running Experiments

Scripts folder contains python scripts used for experimenets

- `run_gen.py` : given some experiment config (modify it in the file), generate completions for functional and blocks
- `run_eval.py`: compute metrics (function and block) based on generated completion data.
