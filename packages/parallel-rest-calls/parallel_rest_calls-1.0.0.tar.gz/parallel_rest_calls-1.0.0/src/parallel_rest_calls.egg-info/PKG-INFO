# Parallel REST Calls

The package provides a couple of methods that can be used to make parallel rest calls to retrieve multiple resources from a single REST collection.
This packages uses [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) package under the hood.

# Usage
For retrieving resources by path
```
parallelize = ParallelCalls(number_of_threads=20)
resource_ids = [2,3,5,8,13]

results = parallelize.path_calls('https://www.sample.com/items', resource_ids)
```

For retrieving resources by query params
```
params = [1,2,3]
results = parallelize.path_calls('https://www.sample.com/items', "param_name" params)
```

The return value is in the following format
```
[
    {'status_code': 200, 'id': 'id_1', 'result': "result_object_1"},
    {'status_code': 200, 'id': 'id_2', 'result': "result_object_2"}
]
```
