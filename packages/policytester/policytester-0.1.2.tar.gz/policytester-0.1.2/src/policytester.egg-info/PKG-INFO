              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Kubernetes Network Policy Tester

Network security is often overlooked in Kubernetes. However, without any network policies 
in place kubernetes deployments are basically identical to a traditional infrastructure 
where tehre is no network segmentation at all. Luckily network policies in Kubernetes
can provide the required network segmentation, see my introudciton post 
[the introduction post](https://brakkee.org/site/index.php/2022/07/23/securing-network-communication-on-kubernetes-using-network-policies/).

However, network policies must be verified since it is easy to make a mistake. That is 
where the policy tester comes in. The tool is written in python and uses existing pods 
running in a kubernetes cluster to verify network commmunication. It does this by 
attaching an epehmeral container to an existing pod so it can verify communications from
this pod to other pods and the internet. Ephemeral contains are a beta feature since 
kubernetes 1.24 which allows to add new containers to existing pods. The main purpose of 
this is for debugging (testing), so these containers are sometimes also called debug
containers. 

This approach allows us to test network communication 
within the cluster and also from within the cluster to the internet. The advantage of 
using ephemeral containers is that it uses existing pods, so the testing environment is 
identical to the actual environmnet, since no separate test pods are created. Therefore,
the tests are representative of the actual situation. The only thing that cannot be tested
are rules from traffic coming in from outside the cluster to the cluster.

## Installation 

```angular2html
pip install policytester
```

## Usage

```angular2html
# prepare pods by adding debug containers to them
policytester prepare tests.yaml

# execute tests for pods
policytester execute tests.yaml

# delete pods that got debug containers attached in any previous prepare steps.
policytester cleanup tests.yaml

```

The current version of the policy tester uses the default kubectl context to connect to.
Future versions of the tool can provide ways to explicitly define a connection to a 
cluster. 

## Documentation

### Verify that a pod can reach the java maven repository at 
`repo1.maven.org` but (most likely) not any other ones. 

```angular2html

pods:
  - name: httpd-wamblee-org
    namespace: exposure
    podname: httpd-wamblee-org
    
addresses:
  - name: internet
    hosts:
      - github.com
      - google.com
  - name: maven-repo
    hosts:
      - repo1.maven.org

connections:
  - name: internet
    addresses:
      - internet
    ports:
      - port: 80
      - port: 443
  - name: maven-repo
    addresses:
      - maven-repo
    ports:
      - port: 80
      - port: 443

rules:
  - name: internet-access
    from: 
      - httpd-wamblee-org
    allowed:
      - maven-repo
    denied:
      - internet
```

The example shows the structure of an input file. First of all we need to define the pods
that we will use. This is done by the following attributes:
* *name*: a symbolic name of the pod by which it can be referred to in the connections section.
* *namespace*: the namespace of the pod
* *podname*: the string that the actual pod name must start with. For instance for deployments,
  pod names are composed of the deployment name followed by a unique id. 

At this moment no other ways of identifyin a pod are possible, but in effect future 
versions of the tool could support podSelectors in the same syntax as kubernetes does
in for instance deployment yaml files. 

Next, addresses must be defined. Addresses are simply fixed IP addresses or hostnames.
They are an alternative to a pod address which is simply the cluster IP of a pod.
Therefore, pods and addresses are similar in that they can represent IP addresses. Therefore,
the names of addresses and pods may not conflict. In the example above, the `internet` 
address is used which refers to an address, but this could also have been the `name` of 
a pod defined in the pods section. 

The next section defines the connections that can be tested as a combination of pod/address
in the addresses field, and ports. 

Finally, there si the rules section that describes from which source addresses which 
connections are allowed or denied. In the example above, we specify that the 
`httpd-wamblee-org` pod can connect to the maven repo at ports 80 and 443, but that 
it cannot connect to github.com and google.com. 


### Pod groups

Since it is annoying to repeat the same rules, there is a possibility to define
groups of pods in the pods section. These pod groups may be referenced just like
any other pod or address using its `name`.

```angular2html
pods:
  - name: httpd-wamblee-org
    namespace: exposure
    podname: httpd-wamblee-org
  - name: httpd-brakkee-org
    namespace: exposure
    podname: httpd-brakkee-org
  # pod group
  - name: all-exposure-pods
    pods:
      - httpd-wamblee-org # refers to earlier pod name
      - httpd-brakkee-org
```

### Address groups

Similar to pod groups address groups can be defined. 

```angular2html
addresses:
  - name: internet
    hosts:
      - github.com
      - google.com 
  - name: dns
    hosts:
      - 192.168.178.1
      - 8.8.8.8
  # address group
  - name: alladdresses
    addresses:
      - internet
      - dns
```

### Protocols

The default protocl is TCP, but UDP may also be specified using the `type` field. 
TCP may also be explicitly specified in this way but it is default. Note however, that 
UDP tests are unreliable. This is because of the nature of UDP. To work around this, a 
future version of this tool could use protocol specific tests for UDP based protocols. 

```angular2html
connections
  - name: dns
    addresses:
    - dns
    ports:
      - port: 53
        type: TCP
      - port: 53
        type: UDP
```

### Test output

The test will output a `junit.xml` file which is suitable for continuous integration, 
as well as some on screen output.
