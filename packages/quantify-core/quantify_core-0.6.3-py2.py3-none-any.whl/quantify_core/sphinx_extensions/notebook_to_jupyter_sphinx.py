r'''
A sphinx extension that converts python Jupyter notebook scripts ``.rst.py`` (or ``.rst.*.py``) in
the percent format to ``.rst`` (``.rst.*``) files to be executed by sphinx.

The extension purpose is to minimize the required overhead for writing and modifying
executable tutorials.

The rationale is to keep things as simple as possible and as easy to debug as possible:

- The code cells are converted into :code:`.. jupyter-execute::` rst directives.
- Raw cells are copy-pasted directly, therefore, they should contain rst contents only.
- Cells in markdown format are ignored.
- The generated :code:`.rst` output files are written to disk for easy inspection. Note that any problems with the rst text will be flagged by sphinx as coming from the output file of this extension. But you are able to insect it to identify the issue (and correct it in the notebook itself!).

Known alternative
-----------------

An alternative to this extensions is to use `nbsphinx in combination with jupytext <https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/custom-formats.html#Example:-Jupytext>`_\. It has neat features, e.g. correctly pointing to the ``.py`` source file. However, `nbsphinx` has some limitations and potentially complicated-to-install dependencies (like pandoc). Such limitations include:

- It is not possible to insert notebook cells inside ``rst`` directives for example inside a drop-down ``.. note::`` directive.
- Specifying that a raw cell is to be interpreted as ``rst`` is `tricky <https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/raw-cells.html>`_ and does not seem to be supported in Jupyter Lab.

Usage
-----

1. Create a Jupyter notebook in the `percent format <https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats.html#the-percent-format>`_ with an extra suffix :code:`.rst.py`, or :code:`.rst.*.py` (e.g. :code:`.rst.txt.py`). The extra suffix is necessary in order to collect the files that are to be converted. The percent format allows to keep the scripts compatible with IPyhton, Jupyter and most IDEs.

    .. tip::

        You can start from the ``.rst.py`` percent-formatted `Notebook template`_ and sync it with an ``.ipynb`` notebook if you wish.

        This is achieved, e.g., with the `jupytext extension <https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/>`_ for Jupyter Lab (pre-installed on recent versions). Open the `Jupyter Lab's Command Palette <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/commands.html>`_ and start typing "Pair". The Jupytext commands should show up.

    .. tip::

        The ``.rst.*.py`` extensions, e.g. ``.rst.txt.py``, will preserve its extension(s). This is supported in order to be able to produce rst files that are ignored by sphinx and can be ``.. include::``\d in other parts of the project. For example, you might want to keep long code example in a separate directory instead of including everything directly inside a docstring of a class. This makes it also easier to modify examples without having to build the docs in order to test that the examples work.

        The rest of the documentation below applies equally for ``.rst.py`` and ``.rst.*.py``, even though the latter is not mentioned explicitly for simplicity.


2. Version control only the :code:`.rst.py` file. Do not commit the :code:`.rst` nor the :code:`.ipynb` files.

    .. tip::

        To ensure this in a git repository add the following to your ``.gitignore`` file:

        .. code-block::

            *.rst.ipynb
            *.py.rst
            *.rst.txt

    .. tip::

        When switching between git branches you might need to clean up all the generated ``*.rst`` files.
        You canuse the following unix commands (or integrate them in the ``Makefile`` your project).

        .. code-block:: console

            $ find . -iname "*.py.rst" -exec rm -f -i {} +
            $ find . -iname "*.rst.txt" -exec rm -f -i {} +

        Remove the ``-i`` option to remove files without confirmation.

3. Add this extension to your sphinx :code:`conf.py` file.

    .. code-block:: python

        extensions = [
            # ...,
            "quantify_core.sphinx_extensions.notebook_to_jupyter_sphinx",
        ]

4. Add the `.rst.py` file(s) in the same location where you would like the `.rst` output file(s) to be generated.

5. Add the file(s) to a table of contents as you would usually do for normal `.rst` file(s). Mind that you do not need to specify the file extension, however, if you do, it must be :code:`.rst` (and not :code:`.rst.py`!).

6. Every time the docs are built by sphinx, the :code:`.rst` file(s) corresponding to all the :code:`.rst.py` file(s) will be generated under the same directory with the same name. This step will be executed right after sphinx loads its settings from the :code:`conf.py` file.

    .. note::

        This extension will process all :code:`.rst.py` files but will only write to
        disk the files that result in different contents compared to the contents of the
        existing :code:`.rst` file. Since sphinx is efficient and does not process files
        that have not changed, this speeds up the development time.

        If you are updating the code that is used in the notebooks you might want to force
        the rebuild of the ``.rst`` files by adding (temporarily) to the ``conf.py``:

        .. code-block::

            # ...
            notebook_to_jupyter_sphinx_always_rebuild = True
            # ...

Code cells configuration magic comment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes it is necessary to pass some configuration options to this extension in order
for it to produce the indented output from code cells. To achieve this a magic comment
is used, currently supporting two configuration keys. The configuration is a dictionary
that will be parsed as json. In addition a python dictionary with specific name can be
defined on the first line of the cell. This can be handy to detect any typos and support
IDE autocomplete.

.. note::

    An experienced reader might suggest using the metadata of cells for this task, which is a more "clean" way of storing this information. Nonetheless, it would be more difficult for non-experienced users to understand it and edit the "hidden" metadata of a cell in a notebook environment.

.. code-block:: python

    rst_conf = {"indent": "    ", "jupyter_execute_options": [":hide-output:"]}

    # ... the rest of the python code in the cell...

**OR**

.. code-block:: python

    # rst-json-conf: {"indent": "    ", "jupyter_execute_options": [":hide-output:"]}

    # ... the rest of the python code in the cell...


The :code:`"indent"` entry specifies the indentation of the
:code:`.. jupyter-execute::` block produced.
You will need this when you intended the block to be included, e.g., inside a
:code:`.. note::`.
You might argue that you could just indent the code in the cell instead, which works in,
e.g., Jupyter Lab, however the :code:`.rst.py` file will become an invalid python file,
confuse auto formatters and linters, etc..

The :code:`"jupyter_execute_options"` entry is a list of directive options that will be
placed on the line below the :code:`.. jupyter-execute::`.

The above example will produce the following in the :code:`.rst` file :

.. code-block:: rst

    .. jupyter-execute::
        :hide-output:

        # ... the rest of the python code in the cell...

.. tip::

    If you wan to suppress the output of a final line in a notebook cell you could
    usually use a :code:`;`. However, if you use a python auto formatter like black in
    the repository, it will get removed.
    To achieve the same effect assign the output of the last line of a cell to the
    :code:`_` variable. E.g., :code:`_ = plt.plot(...)`. You can read more about this
    python feature
    `here <https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/role-underscore-python>`_.

Potential enhancements
----------------------

The extension could be enhanced in a few ways:

- Include the raw rst cells in the notebooks that `jupyter_sphinx` allows to download.
- Make the "View page source"/"Edit on GitHub/GitLab" point to the ``.rst.py`` script instead of the ``.rst``.
- A Jupyter Lab or browser extension for ``rst`` code highlighting (see limitation below).
- Support for using markdown cells directly with conversion to .rst using a tool like MYST.

Known limitations
-----------------

Code highlighting in Jupyter Lab
    Unfortunately it seems that it is not possible to make Jupyter Lab highlight the rst code in the (raw) cells of a notebook, which would be useful for this extension.
    There are some workarounds for Jupyter Notebook involving cell magics but it is not quite worth the effort.

Notebook template
-----------------

To make use of this extensions you can start from this ``template.rst.py``.

.. code-block:: python

    # ---
    # jupyter:
    #   jupytext:
    #     cell_markers: \"\"\"
    #     formats: py:percent
    #     text_representation:
    #       extension: .py
    #       format_name: percent
    #   kernelspec:
    #     display_name: Python 3 (ipykernel)
    #     language: python
    #     name: python3
    # ---

    # %% [raw]
    """
    The contents of this raw cell will be copy-pasted into the ``.rst`` file.
    """

    # %%
    # This is a code cell, will be translated into a `.. jupyter-execute::` block.
    assert 1+1 == 2

Place it in the desired location, rename it and navigate to its location using file
browser in Jupyter Lab. Then right-click the file and under the `Open With` select
`Notebook`. Note that you need a relatively recent version of Jupyter Lab for this
to already be part of the Jupyter Lab interface by default (if not consult the
`jupytext documentation <https://jupytext.readthedocs.io>`_).

The ``cell_markers`` in the header of the template tells `jupytext` to store the
contents of raw notebook cells in the ``.rst.py`` files inside blocks that look like
this:

.. code-block:: python

    # %% [raw]
    """
    Raw cell contents
    goes here
    """

Instead of the default:

.. code-block:: python

    # %% [raw]
    # Raw cell contents
    # goes here

You can remove that line if you wish to use the default representation.
