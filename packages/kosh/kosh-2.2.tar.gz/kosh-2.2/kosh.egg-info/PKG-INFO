# Overview

Kosh allows codes to store, query, share data via an easy-to-use Python API. Kosh lies on top of Sina and as a result can use any database backend supported by Sina.

In addition Kosh aims to make data access and sharing as simple as possible.

Via "loaders", "transformers" and "operators" Kosh can access and process data in a consistent fashion, decoupled from data format and location. 

Kosh is a Hindi word that means *treasury*, which is derived from *Kosha*, a Sanskrit word that means container in either a direct or metaphorical sense. A fairly good translation would be *repository*.

# Getting Started

```bash
pip install kosh
