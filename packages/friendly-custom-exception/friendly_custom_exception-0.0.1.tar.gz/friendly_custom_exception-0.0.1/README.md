# friendly-custom-exception

This is a demo project that illustrates how one can add
the required information so that friendly-traceback can
provide explanations for custom exceptions. By custom
exception, we mean any exception that either is not 
raised by Python modules from the standard library or
or that are raised with different messages specific
to a given library.
