    """Utility functions for ColumnTransformer

    ColumnTransformer is a helpful preprocessing utility from sklearn.
    However, it makes getting the original feature names difficult, which
    makes interpreting feature importance hard. This utility class
    defined a `get_ct_feature_names` function which takes in a
    ColumnTransformer instance and outputs a list of feature names
