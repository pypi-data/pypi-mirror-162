    """The main class to implement the Nim game
    
    This class publishes the following methods. See also the calculation methods
    from the mixin in :mod:`calculations`.

    **Instance Methods:**
    
        :meth:`setup_heaps`
            This creates and initiates the :attr:`heaps` attribute.
        
        :meth:`set_start`
            It sets which party is to start the game.
        
        :meth:`do_move`
            It makes a move, and swaps the :attr:`activeplayer`.
        
        :meth:`get_heapstatus`
            You can get the :attr:`heaps` status (coins in heaps) in a string.
        
        :meth:`game_end`
            It tells you whether the game has ended.

    
    **Instance Attributes:**
    
    Attributes:
        heaps: This :obj:`list` contans the number of coins in the heaps. This is
            initiated in :meth:`setup_heaps` and the actual status can be
            retrieved with :meth:`get_heapstatus`.
        activeplayer: This :obj:`str` is either the "Computer" or "Player" during
            the game. Or "start" in the very beginning when starting player
            has not been selected yet.

    Args:
        error_rate: The rate percentage of mistakes the Computer is to make. By
            deafult it is 0%, i.e. the computer never makes mistakes, and the
            Player has no chance to win (unless the Player decides who to start
            and never makes mistakes). If it was set to the extreme 100%, the
            Computer would always intentionally make wrong moves, practically
            making all attempts to lose. NB, if the Player does the same, the
            Computer may still win.
            
            For testing, when moves of both parties are calculated by the
            program, the error rate of both parties can be set with the
            :obj:`typedefs.ErrorRate`. This can be used to create
            staistics of games played by differently skilled players. NB, still,
            the 1\ :sup:`st` party will be reported in the results as Computer,
            and the 2\ :sup:`nd` as Player, just to name them.
        heapcount_range: The min and max number of heaps to be set up. Less than
            3 heaps makes little sense, more than 15 is a bit of an overkill.
            So, the default is (3-15), but it can be set otherwise. NB, since
            the heaps are displayed with letters (A-Z), the heap number is
            limited to 26.
        coincount_range: The min and max number of coins to be set up in a
            heap. Less than 1 coin makes no sense, more than 20 is a bit of an
            overkill. So, the default is (1-20). NB, since the heap contents are
            displayed in max 2 digits, the coin number is limited to 99.
        misere: Whether it is the "mis√®re" version of the game.

        You can also ask for random selection.

        The `myturn` argument is converted to a boolean, if it arrives as a

        remains the 'a' for subsequent calls and also the outer variable, where
        the argument comes from, remains unaffected.
        
        The (converted) `myturn` value is then used in a :obj:`bool` context.
