# EDL - Experiment Directory Layout

This repository contains specifications for the "Experiment Directory Layout" (EDL) storage layout as
used by the [Syntalos](https://github.com/bothlab/syntalos) data acquisition tool.

It also contains a Python module, `edlio`, to easily load and save data in an EDL structure.
