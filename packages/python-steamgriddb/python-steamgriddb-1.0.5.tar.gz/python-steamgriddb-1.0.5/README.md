Initialize the SteamGridDB using your API key to connect with API
```python
from steamgrid import SteamGridDB

sgdb = SteamGridDB('AuthKey')
```

#### Search for a game:
```python
# Search for Witcher game
result = sgdb.search_game('Witcher')
```

#### Get a game object without searching:
```python
# Get a game using a Game ID
game = sgdb.get_game_by_gameid(1234)

# Get a game using Steam App ID
game = sgdb.get_game_by_steam_appid(567890)

# Returning the game as JSONObject
game.to_json()
```

#### Do something with a game object:
```python
# Return the game name
game_name = game.name

# Return the game release date as datetime
game_release_date = game.release_date
```

#### Get Assets:
```python
from steamgrid import StyleType, PlatformType, MimeType, ImageType

# Get grids list without filter
grids = sgdb.get_grids_by_gameid([1234])

# Get grids list by filter (Multiple filters are allowed)
grids = sgdb.get_grids_by_gameid(game_ids=[1234], styles=[StyleType.Alternate], mimes=[MimeType.PNG], types=[ImageType.Static], is_nsfw=True)

# Get list grids using platform
grids = sgdb.get_grids_by_platform(game_ids=[1234], platform=PlatformType.origin)
```

#### Do something with a grid object:
```python
# Return object of grid's author
grid_author = grid.author

# Return grid's score
grid_score = grid.score

grid_is_nsfw = grid.is_nsfw()

# Returning the grid as JSONObject
grid.to_json()
```
