5. How to retrieve a patch of your settings
===========================================

Once you are satisfied with the configuration, you can retrieve a patch containing all the changes you made to Xcode.

First, make sure your build is stopped.

You can check the list of your ongoing builds with ``appollo build ls`` and the ``--all`` option to see all your other older builds.

Stopping a build manually is possible by using the command ``appollo build stop KEY``.

When your build is stopped, you can create the patch using ``appollo build patch``.

By default, the file is called **appollo.patch** and is located in your app folder.

.. tip::

  Use ``--help`` to see the options of a command. For exemple, with ``appollo build patch`` you have options to name the file of your patch.

To apply the changes, use the git command ``git am appollo.patch``.
