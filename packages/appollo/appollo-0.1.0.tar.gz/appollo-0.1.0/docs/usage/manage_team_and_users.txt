In Appollo CLI, you can **manage your teams** and the **users** that are a part of it.

1. User account commands
========================

To create an account, use the ``appollo signup`` commmand.

You can now also use the ``appollo signin`` and ``appollo signout`` command to log in and out of your account easily.

2. Team commands
================

To manage your teams, simply use the ``appollo team`` command.

.. tip:: You can use the ``--help`` for each command to get information about the next available actions.

If you use the ``appollo team ls`` command, the CLI will return a tree of the teams you belong to.

You can also easily **create** or **delete** a team.

With the ``appollo team mk --name TEXT`` command to create one.

And ``appollo team rm --name TEXT --yes`` to delete one.

3. Team users commands
======================

Using the ``appollo team member`` command will give you access to the commands to manage the users of your teams.

You can **add** or **remove** a user from the teams if you are an admin.

**To add**, enter the following command line :

.. code-block::

  appollo team member add KEY --username TEXT

You can do the same to remove a user with ``rm``.

By validating your input, you will also get an overview of the team you just added or removed a member from.

Do not forget to specify the team you want to add a member to with its key.
