Configure Appollo for Apple
===========================

To properly use Appollo, you have to link your Apple Developer account to it.

In this guide, you will learn how to quickly do it.

**First**, you need to create an Apple API key on |app_store_connect|.

Go over to the Users and Access menu and in the key tab, you will a **plus** sign to generate a key.

Once, you generated your key, you can **copy** it and **download** it.

.. danger:: **You can only download it ONCE. Make sure to save it in a safe place!**

**Second**, to add an Apple Developer account, use the command ``appollo apple add`` in your console.

Your input should look like that:

.. code-block:: none

  appollo apple add --apple-id TEXT --name TEXT --key-id TEXT --issuer-id TEXT
  --private-key TEXT

You can easily find your **Apple ID** (Team ID) in the **membership** menu in the overview of your Apple developer account.

For the **key-id** and **issuer-id**, they are located on the same page where you generated the key.

Just copy them.

By default, the private-key file you downloaded should be saved on your computer as such:

.. code-block:: python

  /Users/USERNAME/Downloads/AuthKey_KeyID.p8

And that is how you can properly link you Appollo account with an Apple Developer account.
