The Appollo tool is composed of :

        - *Appollo-Remote* : The pre-configured build machines which handle the setup, build and release of your app
        - *Appollo-cli* : The CLI command line that works as an interface to start Appollo-Remote build machines

.. note:: Appollo-Remotes are MacOS build machines on which the flutter build of your application is executed.
