## [Description](description)
[tfrmaker](/) helps to ease the manipulation of tfrecords for your next machine learning project with [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow). You can now easily create, extract and load image datasets in the form of tfrecords with help of [tfrmaker](/). With the help of the package, large image datasets can be converted into tfrecords and fed directly into tensorflow models for training and testing purposes. Some key feature of the package includes:
- dynamic resizing
- splitting tfrecords into optimal shards 
- spliting training, validation, testing of tfrecords
- count no of images in tfrecords
- asynchronous tfrecord creation

### Why TFRecords?
TFRecords stores data as a sequence of binary records with help of [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/), a cross-platform, cross-language library. It has many advantages like:

- **Efficient storage**: TFRecord data can take up less space than the original data; it can also be partitioned into multiple files.
- **Fast I/O**: TFRecord format can be read with parallel I/O operations, which is useful for TPUs or multiple hosts.

## [Installation](instalation)
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install tfrmaker.

```sh
pip install tfrmaker
```

## [Usage](usage)
A minimal usage of `tfrmaker` with image data, organized as directores with name as class labels:
```python
from tfrmaker import images, display

# mapping label names with integer encoding.
LABELS = {"bishop": 0, "knight": 1, "pawn": 2, "queen": 3, "rook": 4}

# specifiying data and output directories.
DATA_DIR = "datasets/chess/"
OUTPUT_DIR = "tfrecords/chess/"

# create tfrecords from the images present in the given data directory.
images.create(DATA_DIR, LABELS, OUTPUT_DIR)

# load one or more tfrecords as an iterator object.
dataset = images.load(["tfrecords/chess/queen.tfrecord","tfrecords/chess/bishop.tfrecords"], batch_size=32, repeat=True)

# iterate one batch and visualize it along with labels.
databatch = next(iter(dataset))
display.batch(databatch, LABELS)
```
Refer [examples](/examples) folder for more advanced usage.
