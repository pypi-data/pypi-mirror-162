Beaker
------
<img align="left" src="beaker.png" margin="10px" >

Beaker is a smart contract development framework for [PyTeal](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal) inspired by Flask


With Beaker, we build a class that represents our entire application including state and routing.

*Mostly Untested - Expect Breaking Changes* 


## Hello, Beaker


```py
from pyteal import *
from beaker import *

class HelloBeaker(Application):
    @external
    def hello(self, name: abi.String, *, output: abi.String):
        return output.set(Concat(Bytes("Hello, "), name.get()))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    from algosdk.atomic_transaction_composer import AccountTransactionSigner
    from beaker import sandbox, client

    app = HelloBeaker()

    addr, private_key, signer = sandbox.get_accounts().pop()

    app_client = client.ApplicationClient(
        sandbox.get_algod_client(), app, signer=signer
    )

    app_id, app_addr, txid = app_client.create()

    result = app_client.call(app.hello, name="Beaker")
    print(result.return_value) # Hello, Beaker
```

## Install

You can install from pip:

`pip install beaker-pyteal`

Or from github directly (no promises on stability): 

`pip install git+https://github.com/algorand-devrel/beaker`
