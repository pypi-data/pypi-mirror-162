# PyMathSolver

## What is it?

PyMathSolver is a Python module to solve math problems and work on calculations.

## How to Use it?

Run the following command `pip install PyMathSolver` to install the module.

## Importing

You can import the module `import PyMathSolver`.

When you run `PyMathSolver.about()`, you can get a little more info on this module.

## Utilities

Till now, this module can only work on Quadratic Equations. Later on, I will be adding more and more features.

### 1) Quadratic Equations

To import this, use the following code `from PyMathSolver import Quadratic`. To know more about a quadratic equation, use `Quadratic.definition()`.

To find the roots of a quadratic equations, you can use the `Quadratic.findRoots(a, b, c)` function where a, b, and c are the coefficients that you need to enter. At the end, it will return the 2 solutions.
