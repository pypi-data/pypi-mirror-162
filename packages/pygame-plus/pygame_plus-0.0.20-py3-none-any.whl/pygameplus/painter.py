    A Painter is a special sub-class of a Sprite with extra methods used to 
    draw on the screen.  All methods of a Sprite object can be used on
    Painter objects.

    Some features of Painter objects include:
     - They can draw on the screen when they move.
     - They can be used to draw filled polygons.
     - They can draw dots and circles.
     - They can stamp copies of their image to the screen.
     - They can write text to the screen.
