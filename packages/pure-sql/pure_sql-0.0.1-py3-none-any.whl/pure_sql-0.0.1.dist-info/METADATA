> keep sql outside of Python code

This is just a stripped down version of https://github.com/nackjicholson/aiosql. Only the reading and parsing of
a sql file is being kept. No dynamic SQL query building and no execution.

Reason:
- reduction of magic and complexity
- execution of raw SQL is handled by SQLAlchemy already
- handling SQL dialect variety adds lots of complexity which is already covered by SQLAlchemy
- major benefit is just to reuse raw sql in `file.sql` and be able to execute it within and outside of Python

Installation:
```shell
pip install raw-sql
```
