difftacular: Extra diff-generation commands for Bazaar
======================================================

This `Breezy <https://breezy-vcs.org/>`_ plugin adds a few commands that
perform variants on the basic ``brz diff`` command.

``brz diff-mainline`` performs a diff between the specified revisions,
reflecting only changes originated in the mainline: that is, it first
applies any merges introduced between the old and new revisions to a
temporary copy of the old tree, and then performs a diff between that
temporary copy and the new tree.  For example, this can be used to see
changes introduced while resolving conflicts during a manual merge.

``brz diff-ignore-branches`` performs a diff between the specified
revisions, but ignoring merges from the specified branches.

``brz preview-diff`` performs a preview diff in the style used by Launchpad
merge proposals: it shows the diff that would be introduced by merging the
tip of the source branch into the target branch.  If a prerequisite branch
is also given using the ``--prerequisite-branch`` option, then it will merge
the tip of the prerequisite branch into a temporary copy of the target
branch, and then show the diff that would be introduced by merging the tip
of the source branch into that temporary copy.
