## Overview

`lightsaber` is designed ground up to provide a _simple_, _composible_, and unified
model training framework. It has been designed based on state-of-the-art open source
tools and extended to support the common use cases for disease progression modeling (DPM). 

`lightsaber` provides four main components:

* Data ingestion modules
* Model Trainers
* DPM problem specific model evaluation
* Model tracking and support for post-hoc model evaluation.

Each of these components are designed such that a user should be able to pick some
or all of the modules and embed these seamlessly with their current workflow. 
Futhermore, when used in the recommended manner, `lightsaber` provides a _batteries included_
approach allowing the modeler to focus only on developing the logic of their model and
letting `lightsaber` handle the rest.

Currently, we support the following DPM use cases:

* classification: one or multi-class

Also, we support and extend the following frameworks:

* `scikit-learn` compliant models: for classical models
* `pytorch` compliant models: for general purpose models, including deep learning models.


To summarize, it is thus an `opinionated` take on how DPM should be conducted providing with a 
unified core to abstract and standardize out the engineering, evaluation, model training, and model tracking
to support: **(a) reproducible research, (b) accelarate model development, and (c) standardize model deployment**.

## Installation Instructions

`Lightsaber` is installable as a python package.  

It can be installed using `conda` as:
```
conda install -c conda-forge dpm360-lightsaber
```
 or from `pypi` as:
```
pip install dpm360-lightsaber
```
It can also be installed from source using pip as follows:
* barebones install of `Lightsaber`: `pip install .` 
* with doc support: `pip install .[doc]`
* with time-to-event modeling (T2E) support: `pip install .[t2e]`
* full install with all components: `pip install .[full]`
