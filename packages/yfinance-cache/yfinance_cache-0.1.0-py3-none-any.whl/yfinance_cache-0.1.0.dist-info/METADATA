# yfinance-cache
Caching wrapper for yfinance module. Intelligent caching, not dumb caching of web requests:
- If requested data not in cache, `yfinance` is called
- If all requested data is in cache, return that
- If some in cache but some missing, ask `yfinance` for the missing data

Additional logic decides if cached data needs refresh.

## Interface
Interaction will be identical to yfinance:

```python
import yfinance_cache as yf

msft = yf.Ticker("MSFT")

# get stock info
msft.info

# get historical market data
hist = msft.history(period="max")
...
# etc. See yfinance documentation for full API
```

One difference is in fetching price history:
```python
msft = yf.Ticker(interval="1d", max_age=datetime.timedelta(hours=1), ...)
```
`max_age` controls when to refresh cached data to avoid spam. If market is still open and `max_age` time has passed since last fetch, then today's cached price data will be refreshed. 
Defaults to half of interval. Refresh also triggered if market closed since last fetch.

## Installation

Not uploading to PIP until I am certain this is stable, so to install you need to pull from GitHub.
You also need my fork of `yfinance` (branch 'integrate') with various fixes (eventually will merge upstream): https://github.com/ValueRaider/yfinance/tree/integrate

To override PIP:
```
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "path/to/my/fork/of/yfinance")
import yfinance as yf
print(yf) # verify loading right version
sys.path.insert(0, "path/to/yfinance_cache")
import yfinance_cache as yfc
```

## Known issues / pending tasks

- If a stock event (dividend or split) has occurred since last fetch, then the cached data needs to be adjusted. But not done currently. Should only be a big issue when split or exceptional dividend occurs - a typical dividend has tiny effect on adjusted price.
- Considering adding a 'verify' function, checking all cached data against Yahoo.
- Add refresh check to financials data, then to earnings dates.

## Limitations

Code is being actively developed so some features missing:

- only price data is checked if refresh needed
- `Tickers` class and `download()` not available - use `Ticker.history()`
- pre/post price data not available
