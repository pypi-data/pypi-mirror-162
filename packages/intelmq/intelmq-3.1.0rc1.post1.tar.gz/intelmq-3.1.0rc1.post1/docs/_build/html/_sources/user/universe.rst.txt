IntelMQ Universe
=================

.. contents::

IntelMQ is more than a the core library itself and many programs are developed around in the IntelMQ universe.
This document provides an overview of the ecosystem and all related tools. If you think something is missing, please let us know!

Unless otherwise stated, the products are maintained by the IntelMQ community.

IntelMQ Core
------------

This is IntelMQ itself, as it is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/certtools/intelmq>`_.

The Core includes all the components required for processing data feeds.
This includes the bots, configuration, pipeline, the internal data format, management tools etc.

IntelMQ Manager
---------------

The Manager is the most known software and can be seen as the face of IntelMQ.
This software provides a graphical user interface to the management tool `intelmqctl`.

IntelMQ Webinput CSV
--------------------

A web-based interface to ingest CSV data into IntelMQ with on-line validation and live feedback.

This interface allows inserting "one-shot" data feeds into IntelMQ without the need to configure bots in IntelMQ.

Developed and maintained by `CERT.at <https://cert.at>`_.

IntelMQ Mailgen
------------------

A solution allowing an IntelMQ setup with a complex contact database,
managed by a web interface and sending out aggregated email reports.
In different words: To send grouped notifications to network owners using SMTP.

Developed and maintained by `Intevation <https://intevation.de>`_, initially funded by `BSI <http://bsi.bund.de/>`_.

It consists of these three components, which can also be used on their own.

IntelMQ CertBUND Contact
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The certbund-contact consists of two IntelMQ expert bots, whcih fetch and process the information from the contact database, and scripts to import RIPE data into the contact database.
Based on user-defined rules, the experts determine to which contact the event is to be sent to and which e-mail template and attachment format to use.

→ `Repository: intelmq-certbund-contact <https://github.com/Intevation/intelmq-certbund-contact>`_

IntelMQ Fody
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fody is a web based interface for Mailgen.
It allows to read and edit contacts, query sent mails (tickets) and call up data from the :doc:`eventdb`.

It can also be used to just query the :doc:`eventdb` without using Mailgen.

→ `Repository: intelmq-fody-backend <https://github.com/Intevation/intelmq-fody-backend>`_

intelmq-mailgen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sends emails with grouped event data to the contacts determined by the certbund-contact.
Mails can be encrypted with PGP.

"Constituency Portal" tuency
----------------------------

A web application helping CERTs to enable members of their constituency
to self-administrate how they get warnings related to their network objects
(IP addresses, IP ranges, autonomous systems, domains).
*tuency* is developed by `Intevation <https://intevation.de/>`_ for
`CERT.at <https://cert.at>`_.

If features organizational hierarchies, contact roles, self-administration
and network objects per organization (Autonomous systems, network ranges,
(sub-)domains, RIPE organization handles). A network object claiming and
approval process prevents abuse.
An hierarchical rule-system on the network objects allow fine-grained settings.
The tagging system for contacts and organization complement the
contact-management features of the portal.
Authentication is based on keycloak, which enables the re-use of the user
accounts in the portal.
The integrated API enables IntelMQ to query the portal for the right abuse
contact and notification settings with the
:ref:`intelmq.bots.experts.tuency.expert` expert.

→ `Repository: tuency <https://gitlab.com/Intevation/tuency/tuency>`_


"Constituency Portal" do-portal (not developed any further)
-----------------------------------------------------------

*Note:* The *do-portal* is deprecated and succeeded by *tuency*.

A contact portal with organizational hierarchies, role functionality and network objects based on RIPE, allows self-administration by the contacts.
Can be queried from IntelMQ and integrates the stats-portal.

Originally developed by `CERT-EU <https://cert.europa.eu/>`_, then adapted by `CERT.at <https://cert.at>`_.

→ `Repository: do-portal <https://github.com/certat/do-portal>`_

stats-portal
------------

A Grafana-based statistics portal for the :doc:`eventdb`. Integrated in do-portal.

→ `Repository: stats-portal <https://github.com/certtools/stats-portal>`_

Malware Name Mapping
--------------------

A mapping for malware names of different feeds with different names to a common family name.

→ `Repository: malware_name_mapping <https://github.com/certtools/malware_name_mapping>`_

IntelMQ-Docker
--------------

A repository with tools for IntelMQ docker instance.

Developed and maintained by `CERT.at <https://cert.at>`_.

→ `Repository: intelmq-docker <https://github.com/certat/intelmq-docker>`_
