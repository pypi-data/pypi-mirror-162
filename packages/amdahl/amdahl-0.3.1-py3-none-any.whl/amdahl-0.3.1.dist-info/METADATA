# What does this package do?

This python module contains a pseudo-application that can be used as a black
box to reproduce Amdahl's Law. It does not do real calculations, nor any real
communication, so can easily be overloaded.

The application is installed as a python module with a shell
script wrapper. The only requirement is MPI4PY.

## Background

Amdahl's law posits that some unit of work comprises a proportion $p$ that
benefits from parallel resources, and a proportion $s$ that is constrained to
execute in serial. The theoretical maximum speedup achievable for such a
workload is

$$
S = \frac{1}{s + p/N}
$$

where $S$ is the speedup relative to performing all of the work in serial and
$N$ is the number of parallel workers. A plot of $S$ vs. $N$ ought to look like
this, for $p = 0.89$ ( $s = 1 - p = 0.11$ ):

"Ideal scaling" ( $p = 1$ ) is would be the line $y = x$ (or $S = N$),
represented here by the dotted line.

This graph shows there is a speed limit for every workload, and diminishing
returns on throwing more parallel processors at a problem. It is worth running
a "scaling study" to assess how far away that speed limit might be for the
given task.
