  Build systems are an extremely important detail of any software project. When they work,
  they can feel like magic: you execute a command, and after a series of potentially
  complicated steps, a working binary (or other artifact) is produced! When they don't work,
  they can feel like confusing, non-transparent roadblocks that you wish didn't exist. This
  is typical for any powerful tool: magic or a headache depending on the day and the task.
