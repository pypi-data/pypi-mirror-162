# Installation
```pip install discordwebhook.py```


## Examples

### Basic example
```python
import discordwebhook

# Create the webhook. 
webhook = discordwebhook.Webhook(
    url="webhook_url"
)

# Add embed with title "Embed title", same as discord.py
embed = discordwebhook.Embed(
    title="Embed title",
)

# Add a field to the embed, exactly the same as discord.py
embed.add_field(name="Field title", value="Exact same as discord.py, however is lighter", inline=False)

# Post webhook to URL synchronously. Can be await webhook.send_async to send asynchronously
webhook.send_sync(
    f"This is the message content!", # Webhook message content
    username="Coolo2", # Overwrite webhook username, can also be defined when class is initialized
    embed=embed # Embeds can also be set with embeds=[embed]
)
```
### Fetch example
```python
import discordwebhook 

webhook = discordwebhook.Webhook(
    url="webhook_url"
)

# Can be used synchronously and asynchronously with fetch_data_async. Returns current Webhook class
webhook.fetch_data_sync()

print(webhook.id)
print(webhook.url)

print(webhook.name)
print(webhook.icon_url)

print(webhook.channel_id)
print(webhook.guild_id)
```
### Editing and deleting messages example
```python
import discordwebhook 
import time

# Initialise the webhook object.
webhook = discordwebhook.Webhook(
    url="webhook_url"
)

# Send a message to the webhook
message = webhook.send_sync(
    content="The message content goes here"
)

time.sleep(1) # wait 1 second before editing

# Edit the message with new content, but keep the embed (as it is left empty)
message.edit_sync(
    content="New message content! It has been 1 second since the webhook was sent"
)

time.sleep(5) # wait 5 seconds before deleting

message.delete_sync()
```
