## üöÄ Getting Started

### üì¶ Prerequisites
* Python 3.7+
* Poppler
* google-cloud-vision
* pdf2image
* Pillow

### üí´ Installing

```bash
pip install botcity-cloudvision-plugin
```

**Attention:** This package also depends on a non-Python dependency, `Poppler`. You can find instructions on how to install Poppler for your favorite OS below.


#### Installing Poppler

Poppler is a PDF rendering library based on the xpdf.

Here is how to install Poppler for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

##### Windows

- Download the latest library from [this website](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/).
- After downloading Poppler, we need to extract to the convenient location generally under C drive.
- In my case, the Poppler library bin directory is `C:\poppler-21.11.0\Library\bin`. Now you need to add this directory (`C:\poppler-21.11.0\Library\bin`) to your environment variable Path.

If you have questions on how to add a directory to your Path environment variable [click here](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).

You are now all set!

##### Linux

```bash
apt install poppler-utils
```

##### MacOS

For MacOS please follow the instructions on how to install Poppler available [here](https://macappstore.org/poppler/).

Alternatively, if you are using Anaconda you can install from your favorite channel with:

```bash
conda install poppler
```
