## SUMMARY

> A unique wordlist generator with several types of combinations to choose from, or to mix them all. Capable of receiving words from various sources and outputing them to different encoding types.

## USAGE

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cycurity/wister/main/running.gif "Usage")

```
usage: wister.py [-h] [-c [1-5] [[1-5] ...]] [-d [2-5]] [-e FORMAT] [-i FILE] [-l] [-m [0-49]] [-M [1,50]] [-o FILE] [-N] [-v] [-V] [-w WORDS [WORDS ...]]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c [1-5] [[1-5] ...], --combination [1-5] [[1-5] ...]
                        Select which types of combinations to use.
  -d [2-5], --depth [2-5]
                        Select the depth of word mixing when using combination mode 1. Default: 3
  -e FORMAT, --encode FORMAT
                        Encode/Hash the generated wordlist with a given algorithm: "md5", "base64", "hex", "url", "sha1", "sha256" , "sha512", "sha3-256", "sha3-512"
  -i FILE, --input FILE
                        Select the input file containing the words.
  -l, --list            List the types of combination.
  -m [0-49], --min [0-49]
                        Select minimum characters for output. Default: 0
  -M [1,50], --max [1,50]
                        Select maximum characters for output. Default: 20
  -o FILE, --output FILE
                        Specify the output file. Default: output.lst
  -N, --noprogress      Disables progress bar (increases performance)
  -v, --version         Returns the version of the program.
  -V, --verbose         Verbose the output.
  -w WORDS [WORDS ...], --words WORDS [WORDS ...]
                        Words to generate the output with.
```

## INSTALLATION

The process to install Wister is very simple, just copy the following commands:

PIP module installation:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
$ pip install wister
```

Source compilation:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip git
$ git clone https://github.com/cycurity/wister.git
$ cd wister
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install .
```

## MANUAL

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To run the program, you need to pass at least a set of words, using an input file (`-i` or `--input`), or passing the words manually using the `-w` or `--words` tag. If no more options are passed, the program will just write the specified words to the default output file `output.lst`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 5 types of combinations that can be used (with `-c` or `--combination`) simultaneously : `1. Word Mix`; `2. Case Alternate`; `3. Homograph`; `4. Reverser`; `5. Saltify`. To get more information about each type of combination, you should use the *list* argument (`-l` or `--list`). When using the first combination (Word Mix), you can also select the depth (`-d` / `--depth`) which will define the number of words being mixed together. By default, this value is set to 3. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Addicionally, you can define the maximum generated word length (`-M` or `--max`) or the minimum number of characters required (`-m` or `--min`). By default, the minimum value is set to 0 and the max to 20.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To specify the desired output file, you must use `-o` or `--output`, followed by the filename.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The verbose option (`-V` / `--verbose`) will allow you to follow the generation of the wordlist, by printing the several steps of the program. When this option is enabled, the progress bar is disabled.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Optionally, the generated wordlist can be encoded or hashed, using `-e` or `--encode`, with specific types of algorithms: `md5`, `base64`, `hex`, `url`, `sha1`, `sha256`, `sha512`, `sha3-256`, `sha3-512`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By default, the progress bar is enabled when verbose mode is not. You can also choose to disable it using the `-N` or `--noprogress` flag. Disabling this feature will increase performance, decreasing the overall execution time of the program.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To print the current program version, use `-v` or `--version`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get the usage and help page, use the `-h` flag or `--help`.
