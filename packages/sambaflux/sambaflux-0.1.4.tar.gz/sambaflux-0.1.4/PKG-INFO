# SAMBAflux
## Description
SAMpling Biomarker Analysis is a python package for running flux sampling on metabolic networks.

## Visuals
[add example plots here]

## Getting started
### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- cobrapy
- A solver (GLPK, CPLEX, GUROBI)
- Access to a computer cluster or powerful computer


### Installation
Install via pip:  

```bash
pip install sambaflux
```

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of 
usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Confirmed working models

## Roadmap
- [x] Add support for multiple KOs at once
- [ ] Add the option to reduce flux rates in addition to KO
