# About JPSLUtils
(aka Jupyter Physical Science Lab Utilities)

[Code Repository (Github)](https://github.com/JupyterPhysSciLab/JPSLUtils) |
[On PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/JPSLUtils/)

## Introduction
These are utilities used by multiple packages within the [Jupyter Physical
Science Lab project](https://github.com/JupyterPhysSciLab). It is unlikely 
that anyone but a developer would
have reason to install these independently. They are installed when
required by other packages/modules. **Currently, API documentation is only 
available for the python utilities.** You will have to look at the hints 
below and the code to learn more about the javascript utilities.

## Contents
* This package mostly provides tools for running javascript operations that
impact the notebook. This includes things such as selecting a certain cell,
inserting text into an existing cell, or running python code and using the
result from javascript. Some custom dialogs for user interaction are also
included.
* `JPSL Tools` menu can be installed as well. The command to activate it 
  from python is `JPSLUtils.JPSL_Tools_Menu()`; from javascript 
 `JPSLUtils.createJPSLToolsMenu(); JPSLUtils.init();`. This provides menu 
  access to some of the javascript operations:
    * **Hide cells** that are marked as `JPSL.hide_on_print=true` in the cell 
      metadata.
    This metadata can be set from a menu provided by the 
      [jupyter-instructortools](https://github.com/JupyterPhysSciLab/jupyter-instructortools)
      package. The meta-data can also be set manually, by editing it in the
      notebook.
    * **De-hide cells** marked as `hide_on_print` in the cell metadata.
    * **Hide/Show** input table creation code.
    * **Hide/Show** code marked as hidden. Set using
    [jupyter-instructortools](https://github.com/JupyterPhysSciLab/jupyter-instructortools).
    * **Snippets for initializing some JPSL components and links to their
      documentation** (JupyterPiDAQ, Jupyter Pandas GUI and Algebra with Sympy)
* **NOTE**: if you wish input table creation code and selected code cells 
  hidden without the menu being available, then you need to issue the command 
  `OTJS('JPSLUtils.init();')` in python or just `JPSLUtils.init();` in 
  javascript.

## Change Log
  * 0.7.3 
    * More robust notebook environment detection by reordering of python 
      and javascript calls.
    * Removed asynchronous testing for environment.
    * Updated docs.
  * 0.7.2
    * More \n escaping fixes.
    * Made notebook environment testing wait asynchronously for JS.
    * Now gets JS notebook environment info even when running as a submodule 
      of another module.
    * Docs updated to match.
  * 0.7.1
    * Additional escaping of \n fixes.
  * 0.7.0
    * Enhancements to latex and string escaping to support JupyterLab and 
      Colab. This breaks jupyter-pandas-GUI <=0.6.2.1.
    * Now checks for the environment it is running in (JLab, Colab or 
      NBClassic) and sets the python variable `JPSLUtils.notebookenv = 
      "NBClassic|colab|None"`. `None` probably means JLab.
      The javascript variable `JPSLUtils.env = "NBClassic|JupyterLab|None"` 
      depending upon the environment.
    * Typo and minor bug fixes.
  * 0.6.0
    * First pass at python API documentation.
    * Python cell actions no longer run when a trusted notebook is opened 
      (using `OTJS()`).
    * Reformatted the user name and partner information saved on each 
      initialization.
  * 0.5.9
    * Switch to using hierarchical menus.
    * Now requires JPSLMenus package.
  * 0.5.8
    * additional insert text and selection utilities
  * 0.5.7
    * **Breaking change**: JPSL Tools menu is not automatically activated when
      this package is imported. It now must be activated by an explicit call to
      `JPSLUtils.JPSL_Tools_Menu()`.
    * Can now have package hide table creation code and selected code cells 
      without the menu showing. The call is `OTJS('JPSLUtils.init();')`
  * 0.5.6
    * added `hide/show` input table creation code.
    * added `hide/show` hidden code.
    * initialization now hides input table creation code.
    * initialization now hides code marked for hiding.
  * 0.5.5 
    * added `JPSL Tools` menu to access cell hiding.
    * record name dialog cannot be cancelled.
  * 0.5.4 added cell hiding toggle, which cells to hide chosen with instructor 
    tools.
  * 0.5.3 add `select_containing_cell` and 
    `insert_text_at_beginning_of_current_cell` to JS routines. Add python calls
    `havenp()` to check for `numpy as np` and `havepd()`
    to check for `pandas as pd`  in user name space.
  * 0.5.2 Minor bug fixes and updates to README.
  * 0.5.1 Introduced "one time Javascript" (`OTJS(...)`) alternative to 
    `display(JS(...))`. This allows javascript calls from python that will 
    not be run the next time the notebook is opened and trusted.
  * 0.5.0 Initial release.
