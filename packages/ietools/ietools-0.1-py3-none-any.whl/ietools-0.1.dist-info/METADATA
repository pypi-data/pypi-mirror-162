# ietools
A Python package implementing commonly used Industrial Engineering and Management tools

Author: Gana Natarajan, gana1984@gmail.com
University of Wisconsin - Platteville

There are two main modules and one utility module developed for now. Minimal testing has been performed. So, if anyone notices issues, please add Issues, and we will address it.

The main modules in this version are:
 - EnggEcon - Engineering Economy Module
 - Decision - Decision making under uncertainty module

Utils has utility functions to find an effective interest rate and to provide cash flows adjusted to a Least Common Multiple (LCM) time horizon.

If you use any of these tools, please cite this repository.

Other modules in the making:
1. Inventory Management
2. Aggregate Planning
3. Forecasting
4. Flow Systems Analysis
5. Control Charts
6. Statistical Quality Control

Well-known packages like scipy, pandas, numpy, sklearn, pulp, etc. were used and will be used in developing the modules in this package.
