This is a very basci package for reading and writing lists and dictionaries from and to .txt files.
None of what this package does is complicated and it uses only the standard library.
Literally the only reason I am uploading it to PyPI is because I use it a lot and I work on
many different machines and I often forget to bring the package with me. Having it available as
pip install basic_tab_functions would b very helpful.
