```bash
pip install wordfreak
```

## Usage

```python
import wordfreak

# Takes a text source and extracts the word frequencies from it in order from most -> least occurring.
# Extracts word frequencies from "inputFile.txt" and returns them as a Python dictionary.
wordFrequencies = wordfreak.extractWordFrequencies("C:\\inputFile.txt")

# If an output file path is given, it will also save the results there as JSON.
wordFrequencies = wordfreak.extractWordFrequencies("C:\\inputFile.txt", "C:\\outputFile.json")

# Takes a saved word frequencies JSON file and converts it to a Python dictionary.
# Loads word frequencies from "wordFrequencies.json" and returns them as a Python dictionary.
wordFrequencies = wordfreak.pythonizeWordFrequencies("C:\\wordFrequencies.json")
```
