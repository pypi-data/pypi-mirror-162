GeochemistryPy is **a Python framework** for data-driven geochemistry discovery. It provides an extendable tool and
one-stop shop for **geochemical data analysis**.

The goal of the Geochemistry Py is to create user-friendly and extensible products of high automation for the full cycle
of geochemistry research, including a **python package** and a **software** with a command-line interface in the first stage.

The layout of the Geochemistry Py Version 1.0.0:

The whole package is under construction and the documentation is progressively evolving.
