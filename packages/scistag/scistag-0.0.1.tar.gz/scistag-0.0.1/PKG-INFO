# SciStag

### A stack of helpful libraries & applications for the rapid development of data driven solutions.

This project is still under heavy development and in a very early stage - feel free to experiment with the modules and
examples which are already provided.

The goal of **SciStag** is to bundle the strengths of the many small, awesome Python technologies from OpenCV via Flask
to Pandas and enable users to combine these libraries and build awesome data driven solutions with a minimum amount of
code.

SciStag currently consists of the following so called **stags**:

## SlideStag

- Building interactive presentations in Python using the tools you love with a minimum of code.
- SlideStag4Flask lets you host your interactive presentation as a browser application
- SlideStag4Flutter lets you interact with your solution from an iPad (and from Android device soon too)
- SlideStag4Kivy lets you integrate your solution into or host it via [Kivy](https://github.com/kivy/kivy).

## ImageStag

- PIL? OpenCV? SKImage? Why not leveraging the strengths of all of them?

## MediaStag

- Easy integration of streaming media data such as videos into your solution.

## DataStag

- Low-latency inter-container and -process exchange of image and other binary data for Computer Vision and other data
  intensive microservice architectures.

## RemoteStag

- Remote and asynchronous task execution - such as a neural network inference

## WebStag

* Helpful tools for accessing and processing web data

## FileStag (planned)

* Tools for handling local file and archive data.

## CloudStag (planned)

* Even easier access to cloud services of Azure, AWS & Co.

... more details and examples to come ;-). Estimated official release: Summer 2023.

---

## Setup

SciStag comes completely bundled with all required standard components.

`pip install scistag` or when using poetry `poetry add scistag` and you are ready to go! :)

### Optional components
* ImageStag (and other components using ImageStag) support the rendering of HTML and websites via 
  [imgkit](https://pypi.org/project/imgkit/). If you do not use any of our pre-built Docker images please
  follow the instructions on https://pypi.org/project/imgkit/ for your operating system if you want to make
  use of HTML rendering.
