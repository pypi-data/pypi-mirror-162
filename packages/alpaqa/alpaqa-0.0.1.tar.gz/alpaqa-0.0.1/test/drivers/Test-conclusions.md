# Test conclusions

## Tests

All QPs and all tests without box constraints on x were removed from the test
collection. That left a total of 219 test problems.

## Experiments

Four main experiments were carried out: 
1. ALM+PANOC with standard L-BFGS directions
2. ALM+PANOC with specialized L-BFGS directions without flushing when Î³ changes
3. ALM+LBFGS++ with all box constraints moved to the outer ALM problem
4. ALM+LBFGSB++

(*) Only for tests that converged for all four solvers.

The bottom three statistics are PANOC-specific, so they have no value for the
LBFGS++ columns.

An L-BFGS failure is a non-finite L-BFGS step (infinite or NaN). An L-BFGS 
rejection is a failed curvature or C-BFGS condition, resulting in the update
being rejected.
