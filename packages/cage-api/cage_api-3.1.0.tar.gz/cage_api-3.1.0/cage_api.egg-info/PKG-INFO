Description: 
        ## Cage - remote file access system
        
        Remote file access on computers with installed Cageserver software. 
        
        Cage system supports all major file operations (create, open, delete, read, write etc.) 
        by exchanging transactions via TCP and includes two main parts:
        
          1. **Cageserver** \- a server-side program (Python functions with the main program), 
          which runs on computers on the network whose files require remote access;
        
          2. Class **Cage** (in Python package **cage_api**), whose methods provide remote file operations in applications.
          
        This package includes only Part 2: Cage API, that is used on the client side (in applications).
