virocon is a Python package to compute environmental contours (`user guide`_).

About
-----

virocon can support you to design marine structures, which need to withstand
load combinations based on wave, wind and current. It lets you define
extreme environmental conditions with a given return period using the
environmental contour method.

The following methods are implemented in virocon:

- Defining a joint probability distributions using a global hierarchical model structure
- Estimating the parameters of a global hierarchical model ("Fitting")
- Computing an environmental contour using either the

  - inverse first-order reliability method (IFORM),
  - inverse second-order reliability method (ISORM),
  - the direct sampling contour method or the
  - highest density contour method.
  - Futher, "AND" and "OR" exceedance contours can be calculated.

How to use virocon
------------------
Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Make sure you have installed Python `3.8` or `3.9` by typing

.. code:: console

   python --version

in your `shell`_.

(Older version might work, but are not actively tested)

Install
~~~~~~~
Install the latest version of virocon from PyPI by typing

.. code:: console

   pip install virocon


Alternatively, you can install from virocon repository’s Master branch
by typing

.. code:: console

   pip install https://github.com/virocon-organization/virocon/archive/master.zip
   
   
virocon is also available as a `conda`_ package. We recommend to first create a new environment.

.. code:: console

   conda create --name virocon python=3.9

And then activate that new environment and install virocon.

.. code:: console

   conda activate virocon
   conda install -c virocon-organization virocon


Usage
~~~~~

virocon is designed as an importable package.

The folder `examples`_ contains python files that show how one can
import and use virocon.

As an example, to run the file `hstz_contour_simple.py`_, use
your shell to navigate to the folder that contains the file. Make sure
that you have installed matplotlib and run the Python file by typing

.. code:: console

   python hstz_contour_simple.py

Documentation
-------------
**Learn.** Our `user guide`_ covers installation, requirements and overall work flow.

**Code.** The code’s documentation can be found `here`_.

**Paper.** Our `SoftwareX paper`_ "ViroCon: A software to compute multivariate
extremes using the environmental contour method." provides a concise
description of virocon (version 1).

**Conference presentation.** In a `WESC 2021 presentation`_, we showed how virocon 
(version 2) can be used to support the design process of offshore wind turbines.
