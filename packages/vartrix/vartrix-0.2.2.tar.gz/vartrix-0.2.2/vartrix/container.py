This module includes the Container class upon which all of vartrix is built.

The idea of a container is to contain all of the key-value pairs for some
set of variables or parameters. Keys have an implied heirarchy using a
dot-format. For example, 'A.b' means that 'b' is a subkey of 'A'. All keys
are stored in a simple flat dictionary format, but some extra methods
allow the heirarchy to be used to simplify usage.

    Note:
        A `dotkey` is a dictionary key in the Container. It's called a dotkey
        simply because it's designed to have dots in it to represent a
        heirarchy.
