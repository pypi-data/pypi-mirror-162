## How It Works, Mutable Edition

In HashBox, each attribute is a dict of sets: {attribute value: set(object IDs)}. On find(), object IDs are retrieved 
for each attribute value. Then, set operations are applied to get the final object ID set. Last, the object IDs are 
mapped to objects, which are then returned.

Each MutableAttrIndex contains a dict of set of object IDs.

Well, ok, it's a little more complicated than that. We don't always
use sets, because sets are REALLY inefficient for small collections.

Bytes per integer, by collection size

|              | 1     | 10   | 50   | 100  | 1000 | 10000  |
|--------------|-------|------|------|------|------|--------|
| Python tuple | 56.8  | 14.0 | 9.3  | 8.6  | 32.2 | 39.7   |
| Python set   | 235.6 | 82.1 | 46.0 | 84.5 | 57.2 | 84.6   |
| cykhash set  | 168.5 | 26.5 | 23.6 | 22.3 | 17.0 | 13.6   |
| numpy array  | 169.6 | 23.4 | 11.1 | 9.6  | 8.2  | 8.0    |

Those numbers were measured by examining process-level memory usage before and after
collections were created, so there's a little +/- there.
For example, a set containing a SINGLE INTEGER is actually 248 bytes.

**248.**

**Bytes.**

**For a single 8-byte integer.**

Not kidding, you can check it yourself.
```
from pympler.asizeof import asizeof
asizeof(set([1]))
# Yep, says 248. Yes, that's actually bytes and not bits.
```

Imagine if all our attribute values were unique. We'd have to store a dict of millions of sets of size 1.
Ouch! Yeah, let's not do that. In fact, let's not use Python `set()` at all! We're only storing numbers, so a typed set
will be much more efficient. The `cykhash` sets are just perfect for this. They're about as fast as Python sets,
and around 1/4 the RAM.

For smaller collections, below ~100 numbers, cykhash is a bit inefficient, so we use tuples there instead.
While they are immutable, it's not a big deal to discard a tuple of size 100 and make another one.

And for collections of size 1... we just store the number, no container needed.

Using different collection sizes like this helps keep our memory usage from going too crazy.
While this adds a bit of code complexity, it's a pretty great trade. Uses 1/4 to 1/10 as much RAM.
Just need thorough testing for each collection size, which we have.
