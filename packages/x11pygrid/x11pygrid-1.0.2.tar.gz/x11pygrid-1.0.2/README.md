x11pygrid is a small utility which allows you to easily organize your open windows
by tiling, resizing and positioning them to make the best use of your desktop
real estate. It's easy to configure and supports multiple monitors.

#####
_Notice that, package is renamed from pygrid to x11pygrid._
_Previous name was too similar to the other package in PyPi._

### Requirements ###
* Python3
* X11-based desktop
* python3-gi
* python3-xlib
* single_process

### Default Shortcuts ###
* `ALT`+`CTRL`+`NUMPAD-1` - Move window to bottom left.
* `ALT`+`CTRL`+`NUMPAD-2` - Move window to bottom.
* `ALT`+`CTRL`+`NUMPAD-3` - Move window to bottom right.
* `ALT`+`CTRL`+`NUMPAD-4` - Move window to left.
* `ALT`+`CTRL`+`NUMPAD-5` - Move window to center.
* `ALT`+`CTRL`+`NUMPAD-6` - Move window to right.
* `ALT`+`CTRL`+`NUMPAD-7` - Move window to top left.
* `ALT`+`CTRL`+`NUMPAD-8` - Move window to top.
* `ALT`+`CTRL`+`NUMPAD-9` - Move window to top right.
* `ALT`+`CTRL`+`NUMPAD-0` - Maximize window.
* `ALT`+`CTRL`+`NUMPAD-ENTER` - Cycle window between monitors.

Repeatedly press one of the defined keybindings to cycle through window sizes
available at the desired location on the screen.

### Configuration ###
Configuration is done via a JSON file located at `~/.config/x11pygrid.json`,
which will be created with default options if not found when starting up.

If you have old, customized configuration file, named by old package name
(i.e. in `~/.config/pygrid.json` instead of `~/.config/x11pygrid.json`),
you can just `mv ~/.config/pygrid.json ~/.config/x11pygrid.json`.


The default configuration is below. If you introduce top level sections `'monitor0': {...}`
or `'monitor1': {...}` to provide different options for each monitor on your
system.  Any settings not defined will fall back to user-defined defaults, then
global defaults. NOTE: Updating configuration in this JSON file does *not*
require you to restart PyGrid.

### Installation ###

#### pip ####
The simpliest method, just oneliner:
```bash
pip install --user x11pygrid
```

#### pipx ####
Isolated environments maintained by ```pipx``` are great, but not always totally free.
According to the [Pycairo's documentation](https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html), before installing pycairo, you need to provide few
packages (dependencies): pkg-config and cairo with it's headers. (Indeed, it's a bit paradoxical.)

Obviously, you also need python3-pip, python3-venv and pipx itself. Unfortunately(?), they are not marked
as dependencies of pipx, so you may need to install it first. More about that in the [pipx's documentation](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/troubleshooting/).
Now let's assume you have already installed fully operational pipx.

So, before you execute universal:
```bash
pipx install x11pygrid
```
you need to install dependencies. Obviously â€“ with corresponding to your distro packages manager.
- ##### Ubuntu / Debian #####
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libcairo2-dev pkg-config python3-dev
  pipx install x11pygrid
  ```

- ##### Arch Linux #####
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S cairo pkgconf
  pipx install x11pygrid
  ```

- ##### Fedora #####
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install cairo-devel pkg-config python3-devel
  pipx install x11pygrid
  ```

- ##### openSUSE #####
  ```bash
  sudo zypper install cairo-devel pkg-config python3-devel
  pipx install x11pygrid
  ```

- ##### FreeBSD #####
  ```bash
  sudo pkg install -y devel/pkgconf
  pipx install x11pygrid
  ```
  you can also install pkgconf from ports:
  ```bash
  cd /usr/ports/devel/pkgconf/
  sudo make install clean
  pipx install x11pygrid
  ```

#### From source ####
The only file you really need to install is `x11pygrid.py`, which you can place anywhere you want.
For example:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin/
cd ~/.local/bin/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkkid/x11pygrid/master/src/x11pygrid/x11pygrid.py
mv x11pygrid.py x11pygrid
chmod +x x11pygrid
```
Also you should check if choosen directory is in `echo $PATH` and install dependencies by hand.
Because of that and many other reasons, the best solution is `pipx` or at least `pip`.

### Autostart ###
It is propably the most natural to just add `x11pygrid` to the _Startup Applications_ aka _Autostart_.
Depending on distro and window manager, it can be done in many ways.
It is not recomended to do it by `cron`, because it's X11-dependent.
