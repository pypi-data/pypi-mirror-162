# mangadlmao

A cli script to download and package manga into CBZ for [Komga].

What sets it apart from other scripts like this is that it creates
a `ComicInfo.xml` for [Komga] and it will also download any updated chapters
to get the latest versions with fixes.

## Installation

Install using [pip]:

```console
$ python -m pip install mangadlmao
```

## Configuration

You can get the location of the configuration file by running `mangadlmao -c`
or specify a custom path with `mangadlmao --config=/custom/location/config.yml`

The configuration file format is YAML:

```yaml
