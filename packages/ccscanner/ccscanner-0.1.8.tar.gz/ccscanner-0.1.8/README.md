##  CCScanner
This is a temporary repository to meet the Anonymous Review Policy. You can start the trial by running "scanner.py". An easy-to-use pip package will be released after this paper is accepted.

Since Gitsubmodule and Buck module need some active tokens, such as GitHub token. We comment these modules in this anonymous version. You can still read the code. The upcoming version after paper is accepted will be full-featured.
